   EnableInterrupt Arduino Library
   Copyright 2014-2015 Michael Schwager (aka Mike Schwager aka "GreyGnome")

   This product includes software developed by Mike Schwager.

   This library was inspired and replaces the PinChangeInt library.

   GreyGnome is the current maintainer, and would like to thank all those
   Open Source coders, the Arduino makers and community, and especially Chris
   and Lex for lighting the flame and showing the way! And a big thank you to
   the users who have contributed comments and bug fixes along the way.
   Without you this project would not have overcome some significant hurdles.

   A HUGE thanks to Jan Baeyens ("jantje"), who has graciously DONATED an
   Arduino Mega ADK board to the PinChangeInt project!!! Wow, thanks Jan!
   This makes the 2560-based Arduino Mega a first class supported platform-
   I am able to test it and verify that it works.
