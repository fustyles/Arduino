Version 0.8.1. I forgot to include some fixes for an issue on the website; https://github.com/GreyGnome/EnableInterrupt/issues/13 (having to do with the 1284 chip). These are now included.

Version 0.8.0. This release includes the function to set a variable that can be queried by the programmer's
ISR, to determine which pin was interrupted. Define EI_ARDUINO_INTERRUPTED_PIN in the main sketch.

Also:
My Mega2560 failed right in the middle of testing this release. So that platform is not fully tested.
The InterruptedPin2560.ino sketch was giving me some inconsistent results: I saw  pin 71 interrupted twice,
and pin 70 not at all. I think there is a bug in utility/ei_PinChange2560.h, but I will release before I resolve
this. If there is anyone who could test on the 2560 platform- run the InterruptedPin2560.ino sketch and send me
the output- I would appreciate it.

This release includes compiler directives that allow you to eliminate unneeded ports and memory allocations, to more efficiently utilize code and static RAM. See https://github.com/GreyGnome/EnableInterrupt/wiki/SaveMemory for the new features.

Version 0.6.3 of the library has been released. This release includes an Object Oriented example, OOSimple, in the examples/ directory. There are no other changes since version 0.6.2.

Version 0.6.2. Forgot to update README.md.

Version 0.6.1 of the library has been released. This version is designed to meet the requirements of the 1.5.x Arduino library spec. No code logic was modified; only files were moved and library.properties and keywords.txt files added.

Version 0.6.0 did not include an update to these release notes.

Version 0.5 (Alpha) of the library has been released. This release includes support for the ATmega1284p line of processors (includes ATmega644). The Mighty 1284 is used as the basis.  As I don't have a 1284-based processor, this code compiles but has not been tested (see examples/Might1284p). Bug reports encouraged and welcomed! It would be great if a 644/1284 owner could upload the Might1284p.ino sketch and interrupt every pin and let me know the results.

Code was refactored so that a lot of utility routines were moved into individual .h files. Now there's a lot of files, which appears ugly, but the old way was a lot uglier to my mind and looked like a big bowl of spaghetti with so many #ifdefs strewn about to handle the different chips. It was getting hard to wade through the code.

Version 0.4 - New high speed ("HiSpeed") mode. In this mode, the interrupt routine is predefined:
it ONLY updates a variable. This knocks a couple of microseconds off of the interrupt
routine times; it greatly reduces the number of registers needed to be pushed/popped, and
of course does not require a function call. See the wiki for details, including speed measurements.

Version 0.3 - Arjun reported a bug on the Uno platform:

In file included from Interrupt.ino:1:
/Users/arjunmehta94/Documents/Arduino/libraries/EnableInterrupt-master/EnableInterrupt.h: In function 'void __vector_3()':
/Users/arjunmehta94/Documents/Arduino/libraries/EnableInterrupt-master/EnableInterrupt.h:976: error: 'struct functionPointersPortB' has no member named 'pinSix'
/Users/arjunmehta94/Documents/Arduino/libraries/EnableInterrupt-master/EnableInterrupt.h:977: error: 'struct functionPointersPortB' has no member named 'pinSeven'

I have a Duemilanove; I don't know why I never saw that error. Regardless, I have included some
#ifndef lines in to protect that code from getting compiled.

Also added RELEASE_NOTES to the zip file, and to Git.
